# Grasshopper Workflows Collection

A curated collection of reusable Grasshopper workflows developed over four years, supporting parametric design, environmental analysis, and computational design exploration.

This repository brings together selected Grasshopper definitions created across academic, professional, and research contexts. The workflows are designed to be modular, adaptable, and reusable, enabling rapid design iteration and informed decision-making at different stages of architectural design.

## Focus Areas
- Parametric and rule-based design systems  
- Reusable and scalable Grasshopper workflows  
- Early-stage design exploration and automation  
- Environmental and performance-driven design support  
- Computational thinking applied to architectural problems  

## About
These files represent distilled workflows rather than project-specific scripts. They are intended as a **working library**—to be adapted, extended, and integrated into broader computational design pipelines rather than used as fixed solutions.

## Tools
- Rhino + Grasshopper  
- Parametric modeling techniques  
- Data-driven and logic-based design methods
